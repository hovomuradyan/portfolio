UnitedGlobalGeneration is the biggest school-based camp in Armenia that I and my team organized during the summer of 2023. We hosted more than 350 school-aged students for 2 weeks of intense math and IT classes.

The project got a lot of good feedback and was referred by the first TV channel and radio station in Armenia.
