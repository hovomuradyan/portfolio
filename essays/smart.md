## Are there stupid questions?
No, there are. In scenarios same question in google gives you the exact same answer, posting the question is not always the best practice.
Currently, StackOverFlow closes questions with lack of details or even deletes them. You can read more about the StackOverFlow requirments here: https://stackoverflow.com/help/closed-questions

## spamming 
Posting a questions like "Can I ask a question?" instead of really asking a question or "my code is not working help plsplspls" without actually posting a code are less likely to have answers.

Dublicate question are also being considered as spam and being closed in stackoverflow. Like in this case, question was closed for being a dublicate of original case.
[Dublicate question example](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/424556/why-is-my-question-deemed-lacking-in-information-while-in-fact-it-isnt)

# Time for good examples

Clearly describing the question, showing your code (if applicable) and showing your work on that question is essential part of getting good answers.

[Good question example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) is a good example. Quastioner showed the code, measurments and even thoughts on that question.
That is the reason of getting too many detailed responses and "upvotes"
