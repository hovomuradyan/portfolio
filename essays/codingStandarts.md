Coding standards often spark debates over seemingly trivial details, like whether to use tabs or spaces, but their impact is much deeper. They’re not just about aesthetics but essential for improving software quality, aiding learning, and fostering teamwork.

For me, consistency in coding is crucial. When everyone on a team follows the same guidelines, it makes the code easier to read and maintain. However, I have to say that I dislike the standard of using two spaces for indentation; I much prefer using tabs set to four spaces. To me, four spaces provide better clarity and help highlight the structure of the code. It’s a small detail, but it reflects how coding standards should cater to both individual preferences and team needs.

Using tools like ESLint in VSCode can be a game-changer. At first, tackling those ESLint errors can feel like a chore, but it pushes you to develop better habits and truly understand the language. That initial struggle is part of the learning curve, and as you get more comfortable, it becomes less about fixing errors and more about honing your skills.

In the end, coding standards are about more than just rules; they form the backbone of quality software development. They create a shared language among developers, enhance code quality, and make collaboration smoother. While preferences, like indentation styles, may differ, what matters most is building a codebase that everyone can work with comfortably and effectively.
