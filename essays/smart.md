Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314
Fun Fact: This essay was written by an AI assistant. 

I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly become an integral part of education, especially in fields like Software Engineering. Its ability to assist in problem-solving, code generation, and concept explanation makes it a valuable tool for students. In ICS 314, I have utilized AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and GitHub Co-Pilot to enhance my understanding of course material and to aid in tasks like writing code, debugging, and documenting projects. These tools have played a significant role in my learning journey, complementing traditional teaching methods.

II. Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18):
I didn't use an AI as I thought they were too easy and didn't need any help from AI.

2. In-class Practice WODs:
During in-class practice WODs, I avoided using AI because of time constraints and the need to develop problem-solving skills independently. However, sometimes AI helps me with the  syntaxes of new frameworks.

3. In-class WODs:
Similarly, I refrained from using AI for in-class WODs. The real-time nature of these exercises encouraged me to rely on my understanding and to seek help from peers or the instructor instead.

4. Essays:
For essay assignments, I used ChatGPT to generate outlines and brainstorm ideas. As this class is not writing intensive and has nothing to do with essays, I used AI for that part. Even this essay is structured by AI :)

5. Final Project:
Surely AI was used for fixing syntax-related errors, ESLink staff, etc.

6. Learning a Concept/Tutorial:
AI was instrumental in helping me learn new concepts. For example, when exploring React hooks, I asked ChatGPT, “Explain useEffect with examples.” The explanation was clear and supplemented by practical examples, which reinforced my understanding.

7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord:
I only answered the question that I knew the answers :)

8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question:
ChatGPT is too smart for Smart Question.

10. Coding Example:
For coding examples, I often turned to AI for inspiration. For instance, I asked, “Provide an example of using Underscore.js pluck function to extract properties from an array of objects.” The result was a functional and easy-to-understand example.

11. Explaining Code:
I used AI to explain code snippets that I found confusing. For example, I pasted a piece of code involving nested promises and asked ChatGPT to “explain this code step-by-step.” The detailed breakdown improved my comprehension.

12. Writing Code:
No..

13. Documenting Code:
Mostly didn't use.

14. Quality Assurance:
AI was invaluable for debugging. When encountering ESLint errors, I asked ChatGPT, “What does this ESLint error mean?” and received precise explanations with solutions. However, not all suggestions worked immediately, requiring additional testing.

15. Other Uses in ICS 314:
No.

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

The integration of AI tools has significantly influenced my learning experience. It has enhanced my comprehension of complex topics, improved my coding efficiency, and provided immediate feedback. However, over-reliance on AI sometimes hindered my ability to think independently, requiring a conscious effort to balance its use.

V. Challenges and Opportunities

Challenges included occasional inaccuracies in AI-generated content and the risk of dependency. Despite these limitations, AI offers opportunities for deeper integration into software engineering education, such as personalized learning experiences and real-time code analysis.

VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving, while AI-enhanced approaches provide efficiency and accessibility. Combining both methods ensures engagement, better knowledge retention, and practical skill development, creating a well-rounded educational experience.

VII. Future Considerations

AI’s role in software engineering education will likely expand, with advancements in adaptive learning, real-time feedback, and collaborative tools. However, it will be essential to address challenges like accuracy, ethical considerations, and the potential for over-reliance.

VIII. Conclusion

Reflecting on my use of AI in ICS 314, I recognize its value as a learning tool and a practical aid. While it has enhanced my understanding and efficiency, balancing AI with traditional learning methods remains crucial. Moving forward, optimizing AI integration can further enrich software engineering education, preparing students for future challenges.
